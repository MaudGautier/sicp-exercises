# SICP exercises

These are my solutions to the exercises of the
book ["Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html).

## Getting started

To install MIT-scheme on my M2 mac, I basically followed this
guide: https://kennethfriedman.org/thoughts/2021/mit-scheme-on-apple-silicon/
(except that I _think_ I did not need to comment any line of code because it must have been fixed in the meantime).

I have version `MIT/GNU Scheme 12.1` installed (Binaries can be
found [here](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mit-scheme/stable.pkg/12.1/))

To run the code for an exercise:

```shell
scheme < /path/to/file.scm
```
